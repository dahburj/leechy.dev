# LeechyDev

This blog was built with Svelte.js, Sapper and Firebase
Currently in a newborn state. For me it's a good sandbox to play with some of the technologies
I can't play at work for now.

## Running locally

To start a dev server locally or even deploy the code to the hosting, you'll have to add a firebase
configuration in the `src/firebase-config.js`:

```export default {
  apiKey: ...
  ...
}```
